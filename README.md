I'm not a programmer, I'm a dumbo.
Please let me know if you have better ways to do any of this! 

I am working on and so also actively looking for contributors and anyone willing to help with following:
- Repeat (For Loop) through cue list
- Dim all content to 10% then return (Might be great for this to do audio and video!)
